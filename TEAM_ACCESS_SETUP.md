# Team Access Setup - MandaStrong Studios

## Overview

Your application now has a shared team system where multiple accounts can access the same photos, videos, and files. The "MandaStrong Studios" team has been created with full access for all authorized accounts.

## Authorized Team Members

The following accounts have been granted access to the shared MandaStrong Studios team:

1. **mandastrong1** (Owner)
2. **mandastrongfilmstudios** (Admin)
3. **woolleya129@gmail.com** (Admin)

## How It Works

### Shared Access
- When any authorized team member signs in and uploads files, those files are automatically associated with the MandaStrong Studios team
- All team members can view, access, and manage files uploaded by any other team member
- Files appear in the Media Box for all team members, not just the uploader

### Upload from Anywhere
Team members can upload files from:
- **Google Photos** - Direct access to your Google Photos library
- **Google Drive** - Browse and import from Google Drive
- **Direct URL** - Import files from any web URL
- **Local Files** - Drag and drop or browse local files
- **Chromebook Integration** - Native file picker includes Google Photos

### Security
- Only authenticated team members can access shared files
- Row Level Security policies ensure data is protected
- Each account must sign in to access team resources
- Files are stored securely in Supabase storage
