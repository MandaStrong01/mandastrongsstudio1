HOW TO ADD YOUR THATSALLFOLKS.MP4 VIDEO
==========================================

This placeholder exists because your app references a video file called "thatsallfolks.mp4"
but the actual video file needs to be added to your deployment.

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
1. Create or find your "That's All Folks!" outro video (MP4 format)
2. Place it at: /public/thatsallfolks.mp4
3. The video will be used as an outro/ending for generated movies

WHERE IT'S USED:
----------------
- Page 18: Video preview
- Page 21: Movie outro/ending scene
- Page 23: Final export preview

For local development, you can use any MP4 video file as a placeholder.
For production, ensure the file is included in your build/deployment.

Note: The app will continue to work without this file, but some preview features may not display the outro video.
